- System-wide settings management

### Host Features
- Approve or decline visitor requests
- Pre-approve visitors for streamlined check-in
- Generate QR badges for approved visitors
- Real-time notifications for visitor arrivals
- View visitor history and status

### Gate Features
- Scan QR codes for quick check-in/check-out
- Process walk-in visitors
- View today's expected visitors
- Real-time updates on visitor status changes
- Visitor badge generation

### Performance Features
- Redis caching for visitor details with in-memory fallback
- Configurable cache expiration
- Cache invalidation on data updates
- Asynchronous cache operations

### Visitor Experience
- Pre-registration through hosts
- Quick check-in/check-out with QR codes
- Digital badges for building access
- Automated notifications to hosts upon arrival

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS for modern responsive UI
- Socket.IO client for real-time updates
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API requests

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- JWT for authentication
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Redis for caching visitor details
- RESTful API architecture

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas connection)
- Redis (v5 or newer) - optional, has in-memory fallback
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Visitor_Management_System.git
cd Visitor_Management_System
```

#### Set up the backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/visitor-management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_CACHE_EXPIRATION=3600
USE_REDIS=true
```

If you don't have Redis installed or wish to use the in-memory cache fallback, set:
```
USE_REDIS=false
```

#### Set up the frontend
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Running the application

#### Start the backend server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

#### Start the frontend development server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:5173` and the API at `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## üì± Usage

### Default Credentials

The system is initialized with the following default accounts:

**Admin:**
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

**Gate:**
- Login ID: gate1
- Password: gate123

### Basic Workflow

1. **Admin** creates host accounts and gate staff accounts
2. **Hosts** pre-approve visitors or approve incoming visitor requests
3. **Gate Staff** scans visitor QR codes or processes walk-ins
4. **Visitors** receive digital badges with QR codes for building access
5. **Hosts** receive notifications when their visitors check in

## üìÑ API Documentation

The API follows RESTful principles with the following main endpoints:

- `/api/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/admin`: Admin management endpoints
- `/api/host`: Host operations endpoints
- `/api/gate`: Gate operations endpoints
- `/api/visitors`: Visitor data endpoints

For detailed API documentation, see the [API docs](docs/api.md).

## üîê Caching System

The application uses Redis for caching visitor details to improve performance:

### Features
- **Automatic fallback**: Falls back to in-memory caching when Redis is unavailable
- **Configurable caching**: Adjust cache expiration via environment variables
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatically invalidates cache on data updates
- **Transparent operation**: System continues to work without interruption if Redis is unavailable

For detailed documentation on the caching implementation, see [Redis Documentation](backend/REDIS.md).

## üîí Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- HTTPS support in production
- Input validation and sanitization

## üìä Future Enhancements

- Email and SMS notifications
- Visitor photo capture
- Integration with ID scanners
- Custom badge design options
- Visitor analytics and reporting
- Multi-location support
